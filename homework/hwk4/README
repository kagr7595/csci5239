HW04:  OpenGL 3&4
Kathy Grimes
CSCI 5239
Based off of CSCI 5239 EX06 with the addition of phong()(modified for OpenGL 4) from EX04

HW Requirements:
   Create a program that uses shaders in the OpenGL 3 or 4 style, that is using
the in and out qualifiers to pass variables into or between shaders and pass
variables such as the transformation matrices and light properties into the
shader as uniforms.

   The program must implement lighting and textures, and define the scene using
vertex buffer objects.

   I recommend you start with Example 6 and add lighting and textures to my
shaders.

Run:
    unzip
    qmake
    make
    ./hw04

This is the first time I ran on Windows as I could not get OpenGL 4 to run on my linux machine.  I don't think anything would be missing for linux, however let me know if you have issues.

    Use available dropdown menus to go in-between Fixed Pipeline and Programmable Pipeline 
    Use mouse to move object around (angle)
    Use scroll to zoom in/out on object
    

How long I spent:
    About 10 hours (+ 20ish hours trying to get my machines to work with OpenGL 4).  I got stuck for a couple of hours debugging an issue where I could see something was wrong with a normal or view.  I found out I was multipling the matrices in the wrong order.
