HW06:  Image Processing
Kathy Grimes
CSCI 5239
Based off of CSCI 5239 EX11
Also used many web resources including:

HW Requirements:
Create a program that performs image processing using GLSL.

This is a very domain specific assignment, but the applications are very wide
ranging.  Some examples are

1)  Spatial transformations such as sharpening, blurring, edge detection, etc;
2)  Color transformations;
3)  Resampling transformations such as averaging, anti-aliasing;
4)  Multi-image operations;
5)  Special effects.

Anybody who can write a shader that will sharpen an image so you can read the
license plate from the reflection on somebody's sunglasses gets an automatic A+
in this class.

Hint:  If you need to write to a buffer that is a different size than the
window, Example 11 shows how to create a framebuffer object.

Run:
   qmake
   make
   ./ex11

Time:
~9 hours.  I was originally trying to figure out how to do 'Toon' Shading, however as I was
researching Quantizing, I found all sorts of interesting ways to change an image (of course your ex11 already
had many examples).  I focused more on the different versions of grayscale in this project including
embossing, CMYK filtering, and RGB Grayscale.  I added sliders and checkboxes to give the user some
control on what the image is showing.  Click EmbossGray if you want to see the grayscale version of the embossing.
Click C or M or Y or K to see the filter for each associated value. Emboss also shows half the original coloring.
