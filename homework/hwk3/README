HW03:  Procedural Textures
Kathy Grimes
CSCI 5239
Based off of CSCI 5239 EX03 with the addition of fps from EX04

HW Requirements:
    Investigate the performance of different elements of GLSL.  
    Examples of things you may investigate is float vs. int, 
    performance of constructs like if, select, builtin functions 
    vs. explicit calculation, the cost of transcendental functions,
     inline code vs. function calls, performance differences between
    different video cards or operating systems, etc.

    What the program should do is left to your imagination.  The 
    scene could involve lighting, textures, and similar features, 
    but the assignment is to investigate performance of different 
    ways of doing things.

    Example 4 contains code to calculate frames per second, which 
    measures the overall performance.  Make sure you disable VSYNC 
    so that this measures to true frame rate.

    For this homework I wanted to see fps based on if the modification 
    (if/function) was in the frag or the vert as well as if there was a trend
    when adding the if and function.  I started with a base shader
    then added a modification that was either put into the vert or the frag.


    What I see from my results is that most of the results were pretty steady
    and that there was possibly a slight decrease in the fps.  I was expecting
    larger changes in fps when adding if/functions.  Now some reasons for this is: 
        -that I may not have enough going on in my scene
        -I could be simplifying my if statements and functions so much that 
        the compiler is not branching these modifications, but instead substiuting 
        a simiplified assignment.
        -I am not seeing enough values for fps - perhaps adding a running fps that starts
        once it is passed the initial state change and for at least a minute after
    I do see some differences between frag and vert changes, with the lower fps with 
    the vert changes.  This could mean that my hardware is more vert challenged and that
    I should do more modifications in the frag.  I was not able to try this on another
    machine as of yet, but this would be interesting to test.
    

Run:
    unzip
    qmake
    make
    ./hw03

    Use available dropdown menus to go in-between no shader and shaders for the objects 
    that were supplied in ex03.
    Use X and Y positions during the Light up strobe XY shader
    Use mouse to move object around (angle)
    Use scroll to zoom in/out on object
    

How long I spent:
    About 8 hours
