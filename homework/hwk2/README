HW02:  Procedural Textures
Kathy Grimes
CSCI 5239
Based off of CSCI 5239 EX03

HW Requirements:
    The objects in the scene should be colored using a procedural texture shader.
    You may not use the wave, brick or mandlebrot shaders shown in class.  If you use a
    shader from the text or the web, you should improve it.

    This is your first real shader and is an opportunity to explore a few of the
    features of GLSL.  Appendix C in the text describes the builtin functions which
    provides useful manipulations.

    Your scene should be lit.  You may reuse the phong() function from the example 2
    vertex shader but improvements are always encouraged.

    The resulting shader may be only a few lines long, so make sure you can justify
    and explain every line.

What I did:
    For Switch, Offset & Stripes - does not vary with time or position 
    - The vert file switches the x and y coordinates and then offsets the position
    - The frag file uses sin function to makes stripes
    For Light up strobe XY (reminds me of the light up bouncy balls)
    - The vert file takes in the location of xy (shown in gui) and uses to make the 
      lighting brighter/dimmer(farther apart x and y the brighter the colors) and changes with time
    

Run:
    unzip
    qmake
    make
    ./hw02

    Use available dropdown menus to go in-between no shader and shaders for the objects 
    that were supplied in ex03.
    Use X and Y positions during the Light up strobe XY shader
    Use mouse to move object around (angle)
    Use scroll to zoom in/out on object
    

How long I spent:
    About 6 hours - I played around with some of the functions as I thought it was fun. I really like the
    position offset in the first as it makes the objects for cube and icosohedron look cool!
