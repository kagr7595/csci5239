Flower Field Project:

What I plan to do:
-Use QT
-Use OpenGL3/4
-Have SkyCube
-Create a variety of objects (resizable via trans/rot/scale)
	-flowers(different types), basic trees
-Have lighting
-Use geom/vert/frag shaders to manipulate the objects/add new effects
	- use geom shader to implement grass type objects
	- use the shader to cause the flower to sparkle/shimmer (could be particles or an effect using time)
	- use multiple shaders
-Make it look pretty

Stretch: Try to get bump mapping to work for the base landscape
	

What I did:
I pretty much got everything above working except the stretch goal.  I used many shaders - to seperate land/sky/trees/flowers/grass.  I caused a particle effect using time, bezier function and passing in the normals to .geom.  Made some awesome flowers! (I think this is the prettiest hwk/project I've done!!! I tried to implement some bump mapping for the land texture, but I couldn't get it working so I removed it - -Wasn't able to get tangent space correct. The grass was created using normals of flower/tree data in the geom shader.  Implemnted in OpenGL4 with QT.  The important shaders have _grass/flower/tree/etc in the name. 

Run:
    unzip
    qmake
    make
    ./fproj
    
    (I ran this using Qt Creator in Windows and was not able to run on Linux - please let me know if something does not work/compile like it should)


How long I spent:
    About 60-65 hours.  The worst part is that I had taken a day off of work Tuesday to finish up this project and then the internet has been down for the past 16 hours (was supposed to be back on at 11:56pm Century Link said... - using my cell network to turn this in)
